The NFC module is an excellent solution for enthusiasts, makers, and developers who want to harness the power of NFC technology, whether it's for prototyping or building advanced applications, the NFC module delivers the functionality, reliability, and flexibility needed for a wide range of projects.
The term "NFC" refers to a short-range, high-frequency wireless communication technology that is mostly used in mobile or portable devices. It enables radio connection to be established by just touching two phones together or keeping them a few millimeters apart. Holding two devices together and using a wireless communication link for the final few centimeters makes choosing a target straightforward. Induction-coupling, which uses magnetic induction between two loop antennas operating at a frequency of 13.56MHZ with data rates ranging from 106 kbit/s to 424 kbit/s, is the primary communication method used in NFC. 

This Github provides instructions to get started with the NFC module.

## Getting Started with NFC Module
### Pinout

### NFC Breakout Connection
  <img src = "https://github.com/sbcshop/NFC_Breakout_Software/blob/main/images/breakout%20usb.png">
  - Here you will need to connect Type C to the expansion board.
    
**Note:** BUZ pin -> When a card is detected, the signal goes from a high state to a low state and then back to a high state again.
    
  - Once the NFC Breakout is connected, check your COM Port in the device manager.

    If you don't have the CH340 driver installed on your PC/laptop, then check out [CH340 Driver Installation Manual Guide](https://github.com/sbcshop/NFC_Module/blob/main/documents/CH340%20Driver%20installation%20steps.pdf).
    
  - Download the software folder provided [here](https://github.com/sbcshop/NFC_Module/tree/main/softwares), and run the .exe file, so you will see the below interface of the software.

  - Checkout [Manual](https://github.com/sbcshop/NFC_Module/blob/main/documents/NFC%20Module%20Software%20Usage%20Instruction%20Manual.pdf) having instructions on how to use the NFC module with software for setup and configuration.

 ### NFC module with Raspberry Pi Pico
   - Follow the below connection to use the NFC module with Pico/ Pico W
     
      |Pico | NFC Module | Function |
      |---|---|---|
      |VBUS | 5V | Positive Supply |
      |GND | GND | Ground |
      |GP0 | RX | Serial UART connection |
      |GP1 | TX  | Serial UART connection |

     
   - After this, you can follow the same example (code) and instructions available on [Pico  NFC Expansion GitHub](https://github.com/sbcshop/Pico_NFC_Expansion_Software/tree/main/examples) related to NFC operations.
